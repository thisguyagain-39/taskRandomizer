# "I Want To Do Something, but Don't Know What!," a Task Randomizer App 

tldr: i have adhd. sometimes, I have motivation, but I don't know what to do. Often, this leads to doomscrolling, so I made myself an app to randomize tasks and projects that I need to / should work on, and spit them out when I need *something* to do, but don't know what.
